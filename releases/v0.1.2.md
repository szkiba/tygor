tygor `v0.1.2` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is a patch release, it contains documentation generation improvements.

Documentation for extensions usually includes common sections. For example, how to build k6 with the extension, or download pre-built k6 binaries, etc.

For different extensions, these boilerplate documentation sections differ almost only in the extension name and the repository URL. Consequently, these sections can be easily generated.

The `tygor doc` command can generate these boilerplate sections if the necessary parameters (eg repository name) are specified or detected. Thus, the extension developer does not have to write these sections, and if the tooling changes (e.g. the xk6 tool changes or improves), they are simply re-generable.

By default, GitHub repository and generateable boilerplate sections are automatically detected. This is done by examining the git configuration, the GitHub workflows configuration, and the examples directory.
